Talking about books, I can strongly recommend &quot;Cloud Native Patterns: Designing Change-tolerant Software&quot;, &quot;Architecting for the Cloud: Best Practices&quot;, &quot;Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology &amp; Architecture&quot;, and &quot;Azure for Architects: Implementing Cloud Design, DevOps, IoT, and Serverless Solutions on your Public Cloud&quot;.\n",

      "\n",
      "Roughly speaking, the roadmap for a typical ML&#x2F;AI student looks like this:<p>0) Learn the pre-requisites of math, CS, etc. That usually means calc 1-3, linear algebra, probability and statistics, fundamental cs topics like programming, OOP, data structures and algorithms, etc.<p>1) Elementary machine learning course, which covers all the classic methods.<p>2) Deep Learning, which covers the fundamental parts of DL. Note, though, this one changes fast.<p>From there, you kind of split between ML engineering, or ML research.<p>For ML engineering, you study more technical things that relate to the whole ML-pipeline. Big data, distributed computing, way more software engineering topics.<p>For ML research, you focus more on the science itself - which usually involves reading papers, learning topics which are relevant to your research. This usually means having enough technical skills to translate research papers into code, but not necessarily at a level that makes the code good enough to ship.<p>I&#x27;ll echo what others have said, though, use to tools at hand to implement stuff. It is fun and helpful to implement things from scratch, for the learning, but it is easy to get extremely bogged down trying to implement every model out there.<p>When I tried to learn &quot;practical&quot; ML, I took some model, and tried to implement it in such a way that I could input data via some API, and get back the results. That came with some challenges:<p>- Data processing (typical ETL problem)<p>- Developing and hosting software (core software engineering problems)<p>- API development<p>And then you have the model itself, lots of work goes toward that alone.\n",

      "As someone a wee bit along the journey but with the maths dragging me down a bit, I&#x27;ve found that, while in a perfect world I&#x27;d love to get my maths up to solid 2nd year undergrad level, it&#x27;s just going to take me another year or so. That hasn&#x27;t stopped me moving forwards. I understand y = ax + b, bits of linear algebra, gradient descent, but I still don&#x27;t have the critical intuition to pass a college level maths exam.<p>This has helped me build the intuition for understanding these concepts in ML, and as an experienced developer I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;ve been able to pick up the ML stuff relatively easily - it&#x27;s mostly libraries at the practical level. This has in turn shown me two things: ML is data quality, prep, and monitoring; I actually like the maths: it annoys me that there&#x27;s this whole branch of knowledge that I don&#x27;t grok intuitively and I want to know more. As I go deeper on the maths, I find myself retrospectively contextualising my ML knowledge.<p>So: do both and they&#x27;ll reinforce each other - just accept you&#x27;ll be lost for a bit.<p>Also: working with LLMs is incredible, as you can skip the training step and go straight to using the models. They&#x27;re fucking wild technology.\n",
